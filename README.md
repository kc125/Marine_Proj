# Impact of Human Activities on Marine Biodiversity
Utilized Machine Learning regression techniques to analyze the impact of human-induced habitat degradation on marine biodiversity across the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black Seas. The study revealed significant biodiversity decline, particularly in the Baltic and Black Seas, as indicated by the Shannon Diversity Index. Support Vector Regression (SVR) was used to predict future trends, showing the highest accuracy in the Baltic Sea. The Mediterranean Sea exhibited a relatively stable pattern but still showed signs of biodiversity loss. Findings emphasize the urgent need for conservation efforts, including sustainable fishing, pollution control, and marine protected areas. This research highlights the critical role of proactive measures in preserving marine ecosystems for future generations.
