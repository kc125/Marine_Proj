# Impact of Human Activities on Marine Biodiversity in European region
Utilized Machine Learning regression techniques to analyze the impact of human-induced habitat degradation on marine biodiversity across the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black Seas. The study revealed significant biodiversity decline, particularly in the Baltic and Black Seas, as indicated by the Shannon Diversity Index. Support Vector Regression (SVR) was used to predict future trends, showing the highest accuracy in the Baltic Sea. The Mediterranean Sea exhibited a relatively stable pattern but still showed signs of biodiversity loss. Findings emphasize the urgent need for conservation efforts, including sustainable fishing, pollution control, and marine protected areas. This research highlights the critical role of proactive measures in preserving marine ecosystems for future generations.


# Key Findings:
Negative Impact: Human activities are significantly degrading marine biodiversity in the Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean Seas.

Baltic Sea: Strong negative correlation between human activity and biodiversity, confirmed by the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model.

Black Sea: Slightly weaker but still harmful impact on biodiversity.

Mediterranean Sea: Data is limited, but biodiversity loss is evident.

Human-driven degradation is a major concern across all three regions.

Immediate conservation efforts are essential to prevent further loss.
